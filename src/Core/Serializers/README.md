# 🧠 Serializers
This directory contains serializers for various data formats used in the application. Serializers are responsible for converting complex data types, such as objects or arrays, into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted, such as JSON or XML.

## ✨ Features
- Provides a consistent way to serialize and deserialize data across the application.
- Supports multiple serialization formats, including JSON and XML.
- Allows for customization of serialization behavior through attributes and configuration.
- Ensures that serialized data is compatible with external systems and APIs.
- Supports versioning of serialized data to handle changes in data structures over time.
- Includes error handling and validation during serialization and deserialization processes.

## Classes
- **JsonConvertService**:  Provides JSON serialization and deserialization functionality with configurable options.

## Usage
To use the serializers defined in this module, you can create an instance of the `JsonConvertService` and call its methods to serialize or deserialize data. For example:
```csharp
using var jsonService = new JsonConvertService();
// Serialize an object to JSON
```
