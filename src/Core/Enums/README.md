# 🧠 Enums
This module contains various enumerations (enums) used throughout the application to represent fixed sets of related constants. Enums provide a way to define named constants that can be used to improve code readability and maintainability.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Type Safety**: Enums provide type safety, ensuring that only valid values are used.
- **Readability**: Named constants improve code readability and make it easier to understand the purpose of each value.
- **Maintainability**: Changes to the set of constants can be made in one place, reducing the risk of errors.
- **Consistency**: Using enums ensures that the same set of values is used consistently throughout the codebase.
- **Documentation**: Each enum is documented to explain its purpose and usage.

## 📦 Classes
- 'CachingTypes': Represents different caching strategies used in the application.

## 📝 Usage
To use the constants defined in this module, you can reference them directly in your code. For example:
```csharp
using static YourNamespace.Enums;
// Access a default value
```
