# 🧠 Constants
This folder contains the constants used throughout the application. Constants are defined in a single place to ensure consistency and ease of maintenance.

## ✨ Features
- Allows for easy access to commonly used values, such as default settings, error messages, and other fixed values that do not change during the application's lifecycle.
- Helps to avoid magic strings and numbers in the code, making it more readable and maintainable.
- Provides a centralized location for all constants, making it easier to update and manage them.
- Supports various types of constants, including strings, integers, and other data types as needed.
- Ensures that constants are defined in a way that they can be easily referenced throughout the application without duplication.
- Encourages the use of meaningful names for constants to improve code clarity and understanding.
- Supports localization and internationalization by allowing constants to be defined in a way that can be easily adapted for different languages and cultures.
- Provides a consistent naming convention for constants to enhance code readability and maintainability.
- Supports unit testing by allowing constants to be easily mocked or overridden in test scenarios.
