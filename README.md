# üß† AIEventing

AIEventing is a .NET solution for advanced, AI-assisted event logging and fault analysis. It provides structured logging, resilient HTTP clients, and integration with AI models (such as GPT-4) to analyze exceptions and stack traces, offering actionable insights for developers.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- **Structured Logging:**  
  Customizable, scoped, and structured logging with support for multiple publishers and OpenTelemetry-compliant log events.

- **AI-Powered Fault Analysis:**  
  Integrates with AI models (e.g., GPT-4) to analyze .NET stack traces and suggest fixes.

- **Resilient HTTP Clients:**  
  Uses Polly for retry, circuit breaker, and bulkhead policies to ensure robust communication with external services.

- **Extensible Architecture:**  
  Easily add new log publishers, fault analysis providers, or serialization strategies.

- **Asynchronous, Thread-Safe Publishing:**  
  Log events are published asynchronously for high throughput and minimal application impact.

- **Pluggable Publisher Model:**  
  Swap or combine log output destinations (console, EventSource, file, remote, etc.) by implementing the `IPublisher` interface.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 8.0 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- An API key for your AI model provider (e.g., OpenAI)

### Installation

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/AIEventing.git
cd AIEventing
```

Restore dependencies:

```sh
dotnet restore
```

## üìù Usage


### Configuration


AIEventing requires the following environment variables for AI integration. These are read at runtime and override configuration values if present:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY` ‚Äì Your AI model API key (used for OpenAI)
- `OPENAI_API_BASE_ADDRESS` ‚Äì The base address for the AI API (used for RCA service integration)
- `OPENAI_API_ENDPOINT` ‚Äì The endpoint for the AI API (used for OpenAI integration)
- `OPENAI_MODEL` ‚Äì The model name (e.g., `gpt-4`) for OpenAI
- `RCASERVICE_API_KEY` ‚Äì API key specifically for RCA (Root Cause Analysis) services. Required if you use RCA features.
- `RCASERVICE_API_URL` ‚Äì The full REST endpoint URL for RCA services. Set this to the RCA service address when enabling RCA integration.

> **Note:** If these environment variables are set, they will take precedence over values in your configuration files. This allows for flexible deployment and secure secret management.

---

### Setting Up Environment Variables

You can set environment variables in several ways depending on your operating system and development practices:

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
set OPENAI_API_BASE_ADDRESS=https://api.openai.com/v1
set OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4
```

**Using .env Files for Local Development:**
Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```env
AI_API_KEY=your_api_key
AI_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
AI_MODEL=gpt-4
```
Use tools like [DotNetEnv](https://github.com/tonerdo/dotnet-env) or [dotenv.net](https://github.com/bolorundurowb/dotenv.net) to automatically load these variables in your .NET application during development.

**Best Practices:**
- Avoid spaces around the `=` sign in .env files.
- Restart your terminal or IDE after setting environment variables.
- For production, set environment variables securely in your deployment environment.

### Example: Logging and Fault Analysis

```csharp
var logger = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<ILogger<ApplicationLogger>>();
try
{
    // Your application logic
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    logger.LogError(ex, "An error occurred");
    // The logger will automatically trigger AI-powered fault analysis
}
```

## ‚ú® Logging Infrastructure

AIEventing provides a flexible, extensible logging infrastructure:

- **OpenTelemetry-compliant log event serialization**
- **Customizable log event model via `ILogEvent`**
- **Asynchronous, thread-safe publishing with `ConsolePublisher`**
- **Integration with Microsoft.Extensions.Logging abstractions**
- **Pluggable publisher model via `IPublisher`**
- **EventSource-based logging for ETW and advanced diagnostics**
- **Testability with event counters**

### Registering the Logger

```csharp
// In your DI setup (e.g., Startup.cs or Program.cs)
services.InitializeServices(builder.Configuration);
services.InitializeLogging(builder.Configuration);
```
